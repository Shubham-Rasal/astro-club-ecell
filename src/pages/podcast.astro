          In this episode, we have with us Mr. Anand Daniel, a partner at Accel Partners, a venture capital firm that
          invests in early-stage startups. He is also an alumnus of NITK, graduating in 2001 with a degree in Computer
          Science. He has been a part of the startup ecosystem for over 15 years, and has worked with companies like
          Accel, Intel, and Microsoft. He has also been a part of the founding team of two startups, and has invested in
          over 50 startups. He is also a board member at NITKâ€™s incubation centre, the Centre for Entrepreneurship
          Opportunities and Learning (CEOL). In this episode, we talk about his journey from NITK to Accel, his
          experience as an entrepreneur, and his advice for students who want to get into the startup ecosystem.
